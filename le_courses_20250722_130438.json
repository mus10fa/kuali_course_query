    "description": "This course is designed to provide a true renaissance approach to engineering students' education by immersing them in an international culture where they are challenged to identify important problems that can be addressed through the novel deployment of technology.\n\nWhile this course can be seen as an entrepreneurial course, it is primarily a course to help students look at different approaches to creative problem solving and design thinking. The course provides students with a number of frameworks, tools and workshop experiences to prepare them for their international experience, which they then deploy while on their international assignment.  While the course is primarily for Lassonde students, a number of places will be offered for students from other Faculties working with the BEST program.\n\nThe course consists of pre-travel workshops, interactive lessons and workshops on location (both on the campus of academic partners and through site visits to communities, companies, incubators and investors). In addition, students will be required to work extensively in groups on developing a technology solution to an important problem, and make final presentation to local investors and entrepreneurship and community support organizations. Following the international trip, students must participate in workshops and presentations at Lassonde, to share the lessons learned both with professors and each other. It is intended that there are a number of optional destinations for this course, and consequently a number of partner institutions engaged in the delivery of material at the destination. Before trip - 12 contact hours. During trip - 28 contact hours. After trip - six contact hours. Note that in addition to contact hours, students will be expected to work on their own or in teams for about 20 hours while overseas and four hours once back in Canada. Prerequisites: Permission by Instructor through formal application process (see Appendix C) and may include an interview. ",

The second module introduces various subtractive manufacturing methods, including conventional (i.e., tuning, drilling, milling, and grinding) and advanced (i.e., laser and waterjet cutting) machining in the machine shop. The third module identifies and applies generative design in computer-aided design and machine learning in predictive design. The last module focuses on applying fundamental knowledge of engineering design concepts through a hands-on mini-design group project to apply the theoretical knowledge and design principles they've acquired in a practical context. It promotes problem-solving, critical thinking, teamwork, and communication skills. This practical application of design concepts is essential for preparing students to tackle real-world engineering and design challenges in their future careers.

    "description": "In this course, students explore their role in the profession of mechanical engineering and the relationship between mechanical engineering and society. Students learn about the role of engineering in society, human-centred design principles, working with communities, and technological stewardship principles. These are applied through a major project completed outside of the classroom (e.g. in partnership with a local community or external organization). The course also focuses on various career paths and opportunities, e.g. options in government, private industry, not-for-profit sector, graduate education, entrepreneurial opportunities and technology protection. Students are required to build their professional network, for example, through attending networking events and conducting informational interviews. Finally, this course discusses the professional matters including the value of diversity, allyship in the workplace, life-long learning strategies, working in teams, and giving & receiving feedback. Guest lecturers from industry and other appropriate bodies will be used to provide a firsthand knowledge from practicing engineers and other professionals.

A cohesive thermodynamic framework is developed to evaluate any energy conversion process or technology. The framework is used to understand how energy is transformed from a primary energy source to its ultimate end use. The concepts of primary energy, secondary energy, energy-use sectors (industrial, transportation, residential, commercial, and electric power sectors), energy transmission, and energy storage are illustrated. Electricity generation technologies, including fossil fuels, nuclear, solar, wind, and hydroelectricity, are analyzed and compared in terms of efficiency, cost, and environmental impact. End uses other than electricity, including space heating, industrial process heat, and transportation are emphasized. The requirements for transitioning the Canadian and global energy systems to a sustainable system based on renewable and carbon-neutral technologies are discussed.

    "description": "This project-based course involves a semester-long team project that is limited in scope but open-ended and/or requires multiple solutions. In this project, students will (i) practice the engineering design process to solve an open-ended design problem; (ii) apply computer aid design software and generative design technique to design mechanical components; (iii) the fabrication of mechanical components by additive manufacturing or other subtractive manufacturing techniques (e.g., waterjet or laser cutter); and (iv) integrate the fabricated mechanical components and other networking components into a mechanical system. Lecture sessions are designed to provide complementary training in different areas of project execution such that students will be well-prepared to succeed in their final-year capstone project. Prerequisites: LE/MECH 2201 3.00; LE/MECH 2412 3.00 or LE/MECH 2402 2.00; LE/MECH 2502 3.00; LE/MECH 3202 3.00.",

In addition to the work, students reflect on the relationship of their academic learning to the work experience. Employers also provide their evaluation of the student's performance. Successful completion of at least two work term courses is a requirement of the Mechatronics Engineering program.\n\nPrerequisites: Open only to students with good standing in the Mechatronics Engineering program. This is normally satisfied by completing 45 credits from the TRON degree program checklist including TRON2000 and being in good standing in the TRON program. ",

    "description": "The objectives of 1011 are threefold: providing a first exposure to procedural programming, teaching students a set of computing skills (such as reasoning about algorithms, debugging and hardware interfacing and interaction), and demonstrating how computers are used in a variety of engineering disciplines. It uses problem-based pedagogy to expose the underlying concepts and experiential laboratory activities and projects to implement them. An integrated computing environment (such as MATLAB) is used so that students can learn key programming concepts(such as variables and control flow) without being exposed to complex or abstract constructs. The problems are chosen with consultation with the various engineering disciplines in the Faculty with a view of exposing how computing is used in these disciplines.  In support of program-related objectives, WHMIS I and Active Bystander training will take place in this course. Course credit exclusions: LE/EECS 1541 3.00.",

    "description": "This course illustrates the principles, dominant processes, mathematical descriptions, and practical application of fluid mechanics pertaining to environmental engineering. In this course students gain knowledge of the processes that govern the flow in natural surface water systems including rivers, lakes, and reservoirs. The focus will be on understanding the nature of turbulent flows, shallow water hydraulics, and unsteady transient flow dynamics and how they shape and affect the mixing and transport of mass and pollutants in natural environmental systems. Using a state-of-art computational fluid dynamics tool, students examine the formation of these mechanisms, investigate their impacts on environmental transport, and apply these concepts to control flow and mass transport to mitigate\nhazards in surface water environments. The knowledge of mixing and transport is more important than ever, as scientists and engineers are detecting higher concentrations of known contaminants and discovering new and emerging ones in natural systems.  \n\nThis course aims to equip undergraduate students with key knowledge and skills, critical in interdisciplinary design projects in the areas of fluid mechanics, hydraulics, and environmental science. The knowledge and experiences gained in this course will expand the scope of 4th year Civil Engineering capstone projects. It will also build the foundation for other applied areas in water resources and hydraulics such as\nhydraulic numerical modelling, sedimentology, and river engineering.

The concept of relaying to protect a power system during faults and to maintain the integrity of the system is discussed. Introductory descriptions of electromechanical, static, and digital protective relays are presented and their features are elaborated. The measurement devices used in protection systems are introduced, and their non-ideal features are discussed. The operating principles of various types of relays such as overcurrent, differential, and distance relays are discussed and some coordination techniques and potential applications are covered. In addition, different types of pilot protection schemes implemented using distance and directional relays are introduced. Throughout the course, computer simulations of power systems are used to analyze protection functions. Prerequisite: LE/EECS 3622 4.00 or LE/EECS 4622 4.00 ",

    "description": "This course will cover two or three topics selected from the following list.\n- Approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems, which may not find optimal solutions, but are guaranteed to be close to optimal.\n- Online algorithms, where the input arrives piece by piece and irrevocable decisions about the output must be made before the entire input is known.\n- Randomized algorithms, which make use of random choices and can sometimes be simpler than their deterministic counterparts while solving the problem with high probability or with good expected resource usage.\n- Parametrized algorithms, whose complexity is studied in finer detail to see how it depends on multiple parameters, rather than just input size, which can lead to good performance for certain classes of inputs.\n- Concurrent algorithms, where several processes cooperate to solve a problem and must deal with the difficulties of asynchrony, failures and partial knowledge of the system-wide state.\n- Parallel algorithms, where many processes operate synchronously on data in shared memory to solve a problem much more quickly than a single process can solve it.\n- Algorithmic game theory and mechanism design, where algorithms must be designed for multiple agents who have different goals.\n- Computational geometry, where the goal is to solve problems related to geometric objects such as points, lines, polygons and solid figures.\n- Combinatorial optimization algorithms for maximizing or minimizing some objective function over a finite set of objects\nPrerequisite: Cumulative GPA of 4.50 or better over all major EECS courses (without second digit \"5\"); LE/EECS 3101 3.00 ; SC/MATH 2030 3.00",

    "description": "Algorithmic thinking is used as a framework for solving problems involving concepts from calculus, physics, and chemistry. Course modules will focus on: algorithmic thinking, two-bar linkages, motion of particles and objects, principles of conservation, and spring-mass systems. Students will learn mechanics, derivatives, and curve-sketching on a just-in-time basis in order to solve problems. Though hands-on laboratories students will conduct experiments, analyze data, and learn how to write reports effectively.

(1) Build, prototype, and test a truss-based structure (e.g. a solar panel mounting bracket). (2) Represent a linear system in matrix form and write a computer program to solve the system. (3) Use coding, sensors and actuators to solve a well-defined problem. (4) Apply linear algebra and coding to solve a complex problem involving a large data set (e.g. map building). Linear algebra (matrices, determinants, inverses, linear dependence, linear transformations, spectral theory) and coding (loops, conditional statements, and functions) will be learned on a just-in-time basis. Through the mini-projects, students will develop sketching, prototyping, reflection and presentation skills. Course credit exclusions: SC/MATH 1025 3.00; LE/EECS 1011 3.00.",

    "description": "This course is designed to provide a true renaissance approach to engineering students' education by immersing them in an international culture where they are challenged to identify important problems that can be addressed through the novel deployment of engineering technology. While this course can be seen as an entrepreneurial course, it is primarily a course to help students look at different approaches to creative problem solving and design thinking. The course provides students with a number of frameworks, tools and workshop experiences to prepare them for their international experience, which they then deploy while on their international assignment. While the course is intended primarily for Lassonde students, students from other Faculties working with the BEST program are encouraged to enroll in the course.\nThe course consists of pre-travel workshops, interactive lessons and workshops on location at the campus of international academic partners and through site visits to communities, companies, incubators and investors. Students are required to work in groups while developing a technology-based solution to an important problem, and make presentations to local investors, and entrepreneurship and community support organizations. Following the international trip, students participate in workshops and presentations at Lassonde, to share the lessons learned both with professors and each other. Given the nature of the course it is anticipated that course delivery will be enhanced through guest presentations provided by partner institutions at the international destination. Contact hours: Before trip \u2013 12 contact hours. During trip - 28 contact hours. After trip - six contact hours. Note that in addition to contact hours, students will be expected to work on their own and in teams for about 20 hours while overseas and for four hours once back in Canada. Prerequisites: Permission of the instructor through the formal application process (see Appendix C).  \n",

    "description": "The objective of EECS 1021 is to expand students\u2019 understanding of computational thinking and the interfacing of engineering-relevant hardware and software by removing scaffolding that was originally in place in EECS 1011.  Students are exposed and interact with the underlying concepts of modern programming using a combination of activities, including experiential laboratories, projects and interactive programming assessments. The programming language is chosen so that it is widely used in a variety of applications, is object-oriented, and is of industrial strength (Java is an example of such a language). The problems are chosen in order to expose abstract programming concepts by immersing them in relevant and engaging applications. The experiential laboratory activities incorporate discrete sensors and actuators, focused on dynamic telemetry applications that are common to all branches of engineering. Furthermore, by identifying sensors as concrete inputs and actuators as output objects, students can build event-driven software that connects events to actions. The problems are chosen with consultation with the various engineering disciplines in the School with a view of exposing how computing is used in these disciplines.  Prerequisites: LE/EECS1011 3.00. Course credit exclusions: LE/EECS 1022 3.00. Previously offered as: LE/EECS1020 3.00, LE/CSE 1020 3.00.",

While 1020 and 1021 focuses on the client concern, this course focuses on the concern of the implementer. Hence, rather than using an API (Application Programming Interface) to build an application, the student is asked to implement a given API. Topics include implementing classes (non-utilities, delegation within the class definition, documentation and API generation, implementing contracts), aggregations (implementing aggregates versus compositions and implementing collections), inheritance hierarchies (attribute visibility, overriding methods, abstract classes versus interfaces, inner classes);\r\napplications of aggregation and inheritance in concurrent programming and event-driven programming; recursion; searching and sorting including quick and merge sorts); stacks and queues; linked lists; binary trees.

    "description": "Information networks are effective representations of pairwise relationships between objects. Examples include technological networks (e.g., World Wide Web), online social networks (e.g., Facebook), and biological networks (e.g., Protein-to-Protein interactions). The study of information networks is an emerging discipline of immense importance that combines graph theory, probability and statistics, data mining and analysis, and computational social science. This course provides students with both theoretical knowledge and practical experience of the field by covering models and algorithms of information networks and their basic properties. In addition, analysis of information networks provides the means to explore large, complex data coming from vastly diverse sources and to inform computational problems and better decisions. Topics include: basic graph theory, network measurements, network models, community detection, graph partitioning, link analysis, link prediction, information cascades & epidemics, influence maximization, network ties, recommendation systems, mining graphs, and connections to problems in the social sciences and economics. Prerequisites: cumulative GPA of 4.50 or better over all major EECS courses (without second digit \"5\"), LE/EECS 3421 3.00, LE/EECS 3101 3.00, SC/MATH 2030 3.00 or SC/MATH 2930 3.00.\n\nDate of submission: 2017-03-07",

A mature Integrated Development Environment (such as Java and the Eclipse programming, testing, and debugging environment) is used to expose and provide context to the underlying ideas. Laboratory exercises expose students to a range of real-world problems with a view of motivating computational thinking and grounding the material covered in lectures.

    "description": "Storing, managing, and processing datasets are foundational to both computer science and data science. The enormous size of today's data sets and the specific requirements of modern applications necessitated the growth of a new generation of data management systems, where the emphasis is put on distributed and fault-tolerant processing. New programming paradigms have evolved, an abundance of information  platforms offering data management and analysis solutions appeared and a number of novel methods and tools have been developed. This course introduces the fundamentals of big data storage, retrieval, and processing systems. As these fundamentals are introduced, exemplary\ntechnologies are used to illustrate how big data systems can leverage very large data sets that become available through multiple sources and are characterized by diverse levels of volume (terabytes; billion records), velocity (batch; real-time; streaming) and variety (structured; semi-structured; unstructured). The course aims to provide students with both theoretical knowledge and practical experience of the field by covering recent research on big data systems and their basic properties. Students consider both small and large datasets because both are equally important and justify different trade-offs. Topics include: software frameworks for distributed storage and processing of very large data sets, MapReduce programming model, querying of structured data sets, column stores, key-value stores, document stores, graph databases, distributed stream processing frameworks.

Abstract operations on data structures are specified using pre- and post-conditions and/or system invariants. Trade-offs between a number of different implementations of each abstract data types (ADT) are analyzed. Each algorithm operating on data structures is proved correct using loop invariants or induction. Both\nformal and informal proofs are introduced, but most of the reasoning is done informally. Data structures are coded and unit tested in an object oriented language. Selecting the appropriate ADT and a suitable implementation depending on the application is covered.

Under transportation project evaluation, the course presents fundamental concepts for the economic evaluation of roadway infrastructure improvement projects. Emphasis is placed on user and non-user costs with additional applications of lifecycle cost analysis, benefit-cost analysis, and the integration of these tools to support effective decision making.

    "description": "CSSD1202 covers technologies and skills for full stack web and mobile programming, with a major focus on client-side development, and a smaller focus on server-side implementation. Topics include an introduction to network/Internet protocols; principles of layering, coding by design, and design by contract, particularly applied to web and mobile application architectures; event-driven programming, user interface design, layouts, and dynamic content; server-side model design; client- and server- side scripting; and interacting with data sources. Students will be informed to maintain a security mindset in their development process. Laboratory exercises expose students to a range of real-world problems with a view of enhancing computational thinking and grounding the material covered in lectures. In this journey, students will survey knowledge related to responsive design of full stack web and mobile application development and will learn at least one set of technologies more deeply to develop an industry- or community- inspired web/mobile project while improving skills in software versioning, debugging, and teamwork. The lectures are supplemented by a four-hour weekly lab. The project is developed using a simplified software development process with multiple stages, e.g., documentation/design/development/demonstration. The course promotes self-directed learning, coding by design, design by contract, principle of layering, pair programming or teamwork, use of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), and enhancing students\u2019 e-portfolios.

It outlines cloud services, including use of computation, storage, and networking resources, data engineering and analytics services, security and authentication, and others. It surveys the various cloud models, such as Infrastructure-as-a-Service, Platform-as-a-Service, Software-as-a-Service. It discusses quality of service concepts related to cloud computing including elasticity and scalability, availability and fault tolerance, performance, and security. Finally, it discusses cloud-related economic concepts, such as pricing schemes, cost analysis, and economies of scale. The main objective of the course is for students to acquire a firm grasp on the basic concepts of cloud computing, learn how to set up a cloud infrastructure, and how to deploy and use a software application on such an infrastructure. It is the first specialized course for students in the cloud computing streamThese skills are later enhanced in CSSD 3111 (Software Development for Cloud Computing) and CSSD 4211 (DevOps and SRE for Cloud Computing)\n\nThroughout the term, students will practice these concepts in a team, where they will be asked to develop a simple multitier e-commerce application using the computation, storage and analytics services of a public cloud environment.

It presents a holistic approach to system security covering human, organizational, and environmental aspects. Students will look at common security vulnerabilities included in comprehensive and longitudinal classifications such as OWASP and CWE. From an adversarial perspective, students will also learn how malicious software works, including viruses, malware, ransomware and others. They will learn how to recognize, detect, prevent, and patch these vulnerabilities, as well as to create threat models for them. They will also use fundamental testing and detection tools, including Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Tools. They will explore basic notions of personal and system security including access control, authentication, data encryption and identity management. Moreover, students will review digital investigation methods as part of the software development lifecycle and software quality assurance and discuss the limitations of digital forensics.\n\nThroughout the term, students will practice these concepts in small independent practical assignments individually or in small groups, where they will study small systems that have been intentionally developed with security vulnerabilities for training purposes. Students will analyze these systems for security vulnerabilities, provide reports and evaluations on their security and fix them by applying the appropriate mitigation techniques and patches.Pre-requisites: LE/CSSD 2101 4.00.

    "description": "The objectives of 1012 are threefold: providing a first exposure to event-driven programming, teaching students a set of computing skills (including reasoning about algorithms, tracing programs, test-driven development, unit testing), and providing an introduction to computing within a mobile, net-centric context. It uses problem-based approach to expose the underlying concepts and an experiential laboratory to implement them. A mature mobile software infrastructure \n(such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) is used so that students can pick up key programming concepts (such as variables and control flow) within a client-server context without being bogged down in complex or abstract constructs. Laboratory exercises expose students to a range of real-world problems with a view of motivating computational thinking and grounding the material covered in lecture. Prerequisites: One of (1)-(3) below must be met: (1) (New high school curriculum): One 4U Math course with a grade of at least 75%. (2) Completion of six credits from York University MATH courses (not including courses with second digit 5) with a GPA of 5.00 or better over these credits; (3) Completion of six credits from York University mathematics courses whose second digit is 5, with an average grade not below 7.00 (B+). Course credit exclusions: AP/ITEC 3020 3.00, SC/CSE 2041 4.00 (prior to Summer 2013) Previously offered as: LE/CSE 2041 4.00, LE/EECS 2041 4.00.",

    "description": "Introduction to fundamentals of procedural programming in the context of chemistry. The lecture component is in two parts: some lectures focus on computer programming skills, and other lectures focus on selected topics from chemistry. The laboratory component allows students to strengthen computing skills and understanding of the chemistry concepts through computer simulations and problem solving. Through this experiential journey, students will learn the fundamentals of programming, computational problem solving, as well as the software development process. This course typically runs from week 7 to week 12 of the term. CSSD1101 and CSSD1102 both cover fundamental programming concepts and are meant to reinforce each other by covering those concepts in two different contexts.

    "description": "This course is an introduction to the concepts and tools of computer science as students learn a procedural subset of the Python programming language. Python has a variety of libraries in different domains allowing for the solution of interesting problems which has made it a popular language in industry and the academy. Students do hands-on work to design, write, debug and test computer programs that solve problems computationally.\n\nStudents study variables, assignments, expressions (arithmetic, relational and logical) and sequencing of statements to implement solutions for computational problems, in Python. They document programs with comments and preconditions. They analyze the type correctness of programs via a type checker. They use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to develop, unit-test and debug programs given a problem specification. They apply conditionals (including nested conditionals) to implement algorithms to solve computational problems. They code functions to develop modular programming solutions for computational problems. They apply Python loops (including nested loops) to implement algorithms to solve computational problems. They apply data structures, including tuples, sets, lists and dictionaries, to implement algorithms to solve computational\nproblems. They code simple recursive functions to implement algorithms to solve computational problems. Prerequisites: One of (1)-(3) below must be met: (1) (New high school curriculum): One 4U Math course with a grade of at least 75%. (2) Completion of six credits from York University MATH courses (not including courses with second digit 5) with a GPA of 5.00 or better over these credits; (3) Completion of six credits from York University mathematics courses whose second digit is 5, with an average grade not below 7.00 (B+). \n\n\n\n",

    "description": "DIGT 2102 introduces fundamental data structures and algorithms as well as asymptotic algorithm analysis. Topics include arrays, linked lists, hash tables, queues, search trees, sorting algorithms, graph data structures, elementary graph algorithms (traversal, shortest path, topological sort), and algorithm design techniques such as greedy algorithms, divide and conquer, dynamic programming, and stochastic algorithms.\n\nThe course spans three terms (F, W, S). The course starts with simple data structures and introduces increasingly complex data structures while gradually delving into algorithmic design. The course is organized into three distinct terms, each adding more complexity both on data structures and algorithms. Throughout each term, students will design and implement one or two software applications that require the use of fundamental data structures and search algorithms.  Students will develop their communication skills and enhance their e-portfolio. Prerequisites: LE/DIGT 1201 8.00.

    "description": "DIGT2302 provides a first introduction on cybersecurity exploring security and digital safety concerns both from a user\u2019s and from a system administrator\u2019s perspective. It presents a holistic systems security approach covering human, organizational, and environmental aspects. Students will look at common security vulnerabilities included in comprehensive and longitudinal classifications such as OWASP and CWE. They will learn how to recognize, detect, prevent, and patch these vulnerabilities, as well as to create threat models for them. They will also use fundamental testing and detection tools, including Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Tools. They will explore basic notions of personal and system security including access control, authentication, and identity management. Finally, students will review digital investigation methods as part of the software development lifecycle and software quality assurance and discuss the limitations of digital forensics.\n\nThroughout the term, students will practice these concepts in small independent practical assignments individually or in small groups, where they will study small systems that have been intentionally developed with security vulnerabilities for training purposes. Students will analyze these systems for security vulnerabilities, provide reports and evaluations on their security and fix them by applying the appropriate mitigation techniques and patches.

Topics include implementing classes (delegation within the class definition, documentation and API generation, and implementing contracts), aggregations (implementing aggregates versus compositions and implementing collections), inheritance hierarchies (attribute  visibility, overriding methods, abstract classes, inner classes); generics; examples of event-driven programming; recursion; basic searching and sorting algorithms as OO applications). Examples of  lists; stacks and queues using an OO paradigm. The coverage also includes an introduction to UML  class diagrams and a few basic OO design patterns.\n\nThroughout the term, students develop incrementally in small groups an object-aware software  project using a simplified software development process of at least four phases, professional development technologies such as IDEs (Integrated Development Environment), and testing frameworks. The course promotes self-directed learning, coding by design, design by contract,  principle of layering, pair-programming or teamwork, and enhancing ePortfolio.  Pre-requites: LE/CSSD 1201 4.00. Course credit exclusions: LE/DIGT 1201 8.00, LE/EECS 2030 3.00.",

    "description": "In the past decades, emerging technologies such as the internet, distributed computing, positioning, data mining and augmented reality have caused a paradigm shift to spatial computations and decisions from local-scale, off-line and static system to large-scale, on-line and mobile one. Most of our everyday decisions are closely related to the space we occupy. This rapid advancement of spatial information technology allows us to make timely and accurate spatial decisions. \r\nThis course explores the development of modern web-based architectures of GIS applications which support the spatial decision process over the internet. The course provides a broad introduction to web application architectures, geo-open sources, geo-metadata, OGC standards, 3D spatial data, spatial database interaction and indoor positioning. Using geo-open sources and pre-designed elements (plug-ins, mashups and service scripts), the students will learn how to build a web-based mapping service by themselves through lab assignments and individual term projects. Built on the fundamental principles of GIS introduced in ESSE 3600 (GIS and Spatial Analysis) this course draws from numerous case studies and applications enabling the students to learn how to apply spatial analysis and decision algorithms for implementing a range of web-based and location-based services from health, facility and disaster management to consumer applications.  Two lecture hours and three laboratory hours per week. Prerequisites: LE/EECS 1021 3.00, LE/ESSE 3600 3.00.",

Students will be informed to maintain a security mindset in their development process. In this journey, students will survey knowledge related to responsive design of full stack web and mobile application development and will learn at least one set of technologies more deeply to develop an industry- or community- inspired web/mobile project while improving skills in software versioning, debugging, and teamwork. The lectures are supplemented by practical programming tasks closely integrated with workplace activities. The project is developed using a simplified software development process with multiple stages, e.g., documentation/design/development/demonstration. The course promotes self-directed learning, coding by design, design by contract, the principle of layering, pair-programming or teamwork, the use of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), and enhancing students\u2019 e-portfolios.",

    "description": "Modern computer systems consist of layers of hardware and software that interact to present a particular machine abstraction. This course focuses on the operating system and other pieces of software that build the layers of abstraction that hide the hardware details and system complexities from programs and programmers. This layering of abstractions simplifies programming and allows programmers to reason about and build complex systems. Understanding their implementation allows users to evaluate the system's behaviour and improve its performance. In particular, the relationships and interactions between the various layers of abstraction can have profound effects on the performance, security, and correctness of services and capabilities provided by these abstractions.
